/**
 * The IPFilterRule format is derived from the OctetString Basic AVP Format and uses the ASCII
 * charset. The rule syntax is a modified subset of ipfw(8) from FreeBSD. Packets may be filtered
 * based on the following information that is associated with it:
 *
 * ```
 *    Direction                          (in or out)
 *    Source and destination IP address  (possibly masked)
 *    Protocol
 *    Source and destination port        (lists or ranges)
 *    TCP flags
 *    IP fragment flag
 *    IP options
 *    ICMP types *
 * ```
 *
 * Rules for the appropriate direction are evaluated in order, with the first matched rule
 * terminating the evaluation. Each packet is evaluated once. If no rule matches, the packet is
 * dropped if the last rule evaluated was a permit, and passed if the last rule was a DENY.
 *
 * IPFilterRule filters MUST follow the format:
 *
 * ```
 *     action dir proto from src to dst [options]
 *     action       permit - Allow packets that match the rule.
 *                  deny   - Drop packets that match the rule.
 *     dir          "in" is from the terminal, "out" is to the
 *                  terminal.
 *     proto        An IP protocol specified by number.  The "ip"
 *                  keyword means any protocol will match.
 *     src and dst  [address/mask] [ports]
 *                  The [address/mask] may be specified as:
 *                  ipno       An IPv4 or IPv6 number in dotted-
 *                             quad or canonical IPv6 form.  Only
 *                             this exact IP number will match the
 *                             rule.
 *                  ipno/bits  An IP number as above with a mask
 *                             width of the form 192.0.2.10/24.  In
 *                             this case, all IP numbers from
 *                             192.0.2.0 to 192.0.2.255 will match.
 *                             The bit width MUST be valid for the
 *                             IP version, and the IP number MUST
 *                             NOT have bits set beyond the mask.
 *                             For a match to occur, the same IP
 *                             version must be present in the
 *                             packet that was used in describing
 *                             the IP address.  To test for a
 *                             particular IP version, the bits part
 *                             can be set to zero.  The keyword
 *                             "any" is 0.0.0.0/0 or the IPv6
 *                             equivalent.  The keyword "assigned"
 *                             is the address or set of addresses
 *                             assigned to the terminal.  For IPv4,
 *                             a typical first rule is often "deny
 *                             in ip! assigned".
 *                  The sense of the match can be inverted by
 *                  preceding an address with the not modifier (!),
 *                  causing all other addresses to be matched
 *                  instead.  This does not affect the selection of
 *                  port numbers.
 *                  With the TCP, UDP, and SCTP protocols, optional
 *                  ports may be specified as:
 *                     {port/port-port}[,ports[,...]]
 *                   The '-' notation specifies a range of ports
 *                  (including boundaries).
 *                  Fragmented packets that have a non-zero offset
 *                  (i.e., not the first fragment) will never match
 *                  a rule that has one or more port
 *                  specifications.  See the frag option for
 *                  details on matching fragmented packets.
 *     options:
 *        frag    Match if the packet is a fragment and this is not
 *                the first fragment of the datagram.  frag may not
 *                be used in conjunction with either tcpflags or
 *                TCP/UDP port specifications.
 *        ipoptions spec
 *                Match if the IP header contains the comma-separated
 *                list of options specified in spec.  The
 *                supported IP options are:
 *                ssrr (strict source route), lsrr (loose source
 *                route), rr (record packet route), and ts
 *                (timestamp).  The absence of a particular option
 *                may be denoted with a '!'.
 *        tcpoptions spec
 *                Match if the TCP header contains the comma-separated
 *                list of options specified in spec.  The
 *                supported TCP options are:
 *                mss (maximum segment size), window (tcp window
 *                advertisement), sack (selective ack), ts (rfc1323
 *                timestamp), and cc (rfc1644 t/tcp connection
 *                count).  The absence of a particular option may
 *                be denoted with a '!'.
 *        established
 *                TCP packets only.  Match packets that have the RST
 *                or ACK bits set.
 *        setup   TCP packets only.  Match packets that have the SYN
 *                bit set but no ACK bit.
 *        tcpflags spec
 *                TCP packets only.  Match if the TCP header
 *                contains the comma-separated list of flags
 *                specified in spec.  The supported TCP flags are:
 *                fin, syn, rst, psh, ack, and urg.  The absence of a
 *                particular flag may be denoted with a '!'.  A rule
 *                that contains a tcpflags specification can never
 *                match a fragmented packet that has a non-zero
 *                offset.  See the frag option for details on
 *                matching fragmented packets.
 *        icmptypes types
 *                ICMP packets only.  Match if the ICMP type is in
 *                the list types.  The list may be specified as any
 *                combination of ranges or individual types
 *                separated by commas.  Both the numeric values and
 *                the symbolic values listed below can be used.  The
 *                supported ICMP types are:
 *                echo reply (0), destination unreachable (3),
 *                source quench (4), redirect (5), echo request
 *                (8), router advertisement (9), router
 *                solicitation (10), time-to-live exceeded (11), IP
 *                header bad (12), timestamp request (13),
 *                timestamp reply (14), information request (15),
 *                information reply (16), address mask request (17),
 *                and address mask reply (18).
 * ```
 *
 * There is one kind of packet that the access device MUST always discard, that is an IP fragment
 * with a fragment offset of one. This is a valid packet, but it only has one use, to try to
 * circumvent firewalls.
 *
 * An access device that is unable to interpret or apply a deny rule MUST terminate the session.
 * An access device that is unable to interpret or apply a permit rule MAY apply a more restrictive
 * rule. An access device MAY APPLY DENY rules of its own before the supplied rules, for example to
 * protect the access device owner's infrastructure.
